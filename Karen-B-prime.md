Karen tone B' is attested only with non-voiced initials.

I suggest that "Tone B'" items:
1. Were characterized by a final obstruent that was not an oral stop.
2. With voiced initials, merged completely with another tone (most likely B) prior to any tone split.

(2) explains the merger with checked syllables in the central languages—those that preserved no trace of final obstruents—and with non-checked syllables in the peripheral languages, which merged but preserved final obstruents.

Evidently initial voicing is less friendly to final obstruency than non voicing.

For a parallel case of checked syllables merging with nonchecked when conditioned by voiced initials, but not unvoiced, cf. Biao Min (Mienic: Solnit 1985),

\*-p t > -n

\*-k > -&#660;

Tone D1 remains distinct, ending in glottal stop (54&#660;).

Tones B2/C2/D2 merge as 42&#660;. The final glottal stop is synchronically a feature of the tone. Diachronically it is a merger of a tonal feature with a final consonantal feature (+consonantal?). Similarly final -n merges final nasals (m n &#331;) with stops p t.

But D2 is distinguished
a) by not undergoing sandhi
b) by causing voiced initial obstruents to become aspirated, and voiced sonorants to become voiceless (prenasalized obstruents become voiced, as in all other tones).
